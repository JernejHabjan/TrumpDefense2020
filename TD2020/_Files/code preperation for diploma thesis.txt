08: Map building of buildings in ue4
09: Todo: fix running ue4 python script tensorflow errors - connected to grid
10: Helping @home
11: Helping @home
12: Helping @home
13: Helping @home
    Create widget to display remaining time and buttons that will order computer ai actions -> Human player component
14: Link all other actions and test them via buttons up down left right, mine....
################
15: Time to polish actions linking in ue5
16: Time to polish actions linking in ue4
    Email mentors about completed visualizations
17: Try building model and make sure you can run this script on work laptop to build model @work over night
18: Figure out formula for destroying actors over time and how to prevent both players getting destroyed at same time
19: implement formula for destroying actors (even if it destroys both players)
20: Helping @home
    Destroying actors with formula with their healing - implement healing and test it
21: General overlook through scirpts and fix possible errors/ bugs  
    Possible email to mentors about formula
################
22: Day off
23: Test building model and check its results w and w/o one hot encoding
    Leave computer at work over night to build model to test if building of model actually works
24: Wrap "badly built model" in ue4 and run from ue4 with possibility of packaging
25: Waste whole day with trying to package project
26: Wrap py code up, cleanup comments, document everything
27: Helping @home
    Learning model configs, excluding idle state etc
28: Learning model with other configs, encodings, testing results in pygame
    Possible change of timeout formula to make it more strict..
    Document changes made by changing parameters
    Possible NN model change
################ 
29: Day off
    Take a look at results and email mentors
30: Wrapping of code and changing model according to mentors' proposition
31: Changing of code accoring to proposition
1: Leave computer at work over night to build model with preset config of iterations, sims etc.
    Another round of code cleanup and finalizing connection to ue4
    Document ue4 connection and wrap it in module
2: Summing possible errors in prebuilt model
3: Helping @home
4: More error debugging 
################
5: Day off
    Leave computer at work over night with different config
6: Leave computer at work over night with fixed config and one hot encoding
7: Leave computer at work over night with fixed config and w/o one hot encoding
8: Evaluate best model in ue4 and start writing diploma thesis
